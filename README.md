## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: Used for frontend UI, enabling dynamic and interactive components that enhance the user experience.
- **Selenium**: For browser automation, enabling end-to-end testing of the application.
- **JUnit**: A framework for unit testing, providing structure to test individual components.
- **Jenkins**: To automate the testing pipeline, integrating it with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the test environment, ensuring consistency and reliability across testing instances.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Critical Functionalities**: Analyze and prioritize features for automation based on frequency of change and impact on end users.
2. **Set Up Testing Environment**: Use Docker and Jenkins to create a consistent and replicable test environment.
3. **Write Test Scripts**: Develop scripts for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using JUnit and Selenium.
4. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Link automated tests to Jenkins to ensure they run on each code commit or pull request.
5. **Analyze and Optimize**: Regularly review test results to optimize test cases and update them based on new functionalities or code refactoring.

## Results

The implementation of automated testing resulted in:
- **35% increase** in code coverage, enhancing the overall reliability of new releases.
- **40% reduction** in manual testing time, allowing QA teams to focus on more complex and critical tests.
- **30% faster release cycle**, enabling more frequent and dependable deployments of new functionalities.
